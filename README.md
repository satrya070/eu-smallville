# 2.5 Unreal Engine 5 platform action game
This 2.5D game project was inspired by the old gba game Batman vengeance. It takes place in a similar setting as the initial levels of the game, with some similar combat and move mechanics. It acts as a base that I can work from in future, when I (hopefully) gain the skills to model the assets myself to properly recreate levels of the game.

It created using a combination of c++ and blueprints, AI behavior trees, events.
